Currently I'm part of a new research group thinking about advanced AI. Before that, I worked at [Longview Philanthropy](https://www.longview.org/), and I was a Research Scholar and assistant to [Toby Ord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Ord) at Oxford University's [Future of Humanity Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Humanity_Institute).

I'm interested in finding ways to help the future go well, including ideas around [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and [progress studies](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/). I [sometimes write](/writing) about this kind of thing.

Also:

- I co-host a podcast called [Hear This Idea](https://www.hearthisidea.com), about about ideas for solving important problems, and the people working on them
- I was a fellow on the inaugural '[Roots of Progress](https://fellowship.rootsofprogress.org/fellows/)' writing fellowship
- I continue to informally work with (and learn from) [Toby Ord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Ord)
- I've thought about [some EA project ideas](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/writing/ea-projects) I'd like to help make happen
- I researched [space governance](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/space-governance/) as an EA cause area (and now advise a [couple](https://spacefuturesinitiative.org/) [groups](https://governance.space/) which were since established)
- I worked on a policy brief about a [UN Declaration on Future Generations](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/publications/toward-declaration-future-generations)
- I helped [set up a contest](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8hvmvrgcxJJ2pYR4X/announcing-a-contest-ea-criticism-and-red-teaming) to support EA criticism

Before this, I interned with [Charity Entrepreneurship](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/), and helped [Liv Boeree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv_Boeree) make [videos](https://youtu.be/kM7J56OxA6w). Before _that_, I did philosophy at Cambridge.

In my free time I [read](http://www.goodreads.com/finm), [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/finmoorhouse), listen to [music](https://rateyourmusic.com/collection/finm/r0.5-5.0,ss.rd), practise [BJJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu), and play chess badly.
