Currently, I'm a Research Fellow at [Forethought](https://www.forethought.org/). Before that, I worked at [Longview Philanthropy](https://www.longview.org/) and Oxford's [Future of Humanity Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Humanity_Institute), and studied philosophy at Cambridge.

I write for a living and for fun. To that end, I'm interested in ideas around [progress studies](https://patrickcollison.com/progress), [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism), and progress in artificial intelligence. Much of my writing [lives on this website](/writing).

I host a couple of podcasts: [ForeCast](https://www.forethought.org/subscribe#podcast), about advanced AI and how to productively worry about it; and [Hear This Idea](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/), about whatever my friend [Luca](https://www.lucarighetti.com/) and I get interested in (though it's on indefinite hiatus).

I [read](http://www.goodreads.com/finm), [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/finmoorhouse), listen to [music](https://rateyourmusic.com/collection/finm/r0.5-5.0,ss.dd.rd), practice [BJJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu), and play chess badly.

In past lives, I was a [Roots of Progress](https://fellowship.rootsofprogress.org/fellows/) writing fellow, interned with [Charity Entrepreneurship](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/), helped make videos for [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv_Boeree) [communicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_Boemeke), got into filmmaking, and took rowing too seriously.
