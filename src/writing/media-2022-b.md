description: Reading and listening highlights from the second half of 2022.
---
This is me listing things I enjoyed reading / hearing / watching from the first half of 2022. [Here are my highlights](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2021) for all of 2021.

Ordering remains arbitrary. Let me know if you find something from this list that you end up enjoying.

## Books

I keep track of what I read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38695642-fin-moorhouse).

- Joan Didion — [Slouching Towards Bethlehem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424.Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem)
- Carl Sagan — [Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61665.Billions_Billions)
- Steven Levy — [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56829.Hackers)
- {% note "John Green — [The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55145261-the-anthropocene-reviewed)" %}It's a YA fiction author making a book-based-on-the-podcast of charming but sometimes schmaltzy essays reviewing various bits of the universe. But actually it was great and the essay on ["humanity's temporal range"](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-humanitys-temporal-range) made me teary.{% endnote %}
- Josh Greene — [Moral Tribes: Emotion, Reason, and the Gap Between Us and Them](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707599-moral-tribes)
- Scott Alexander — Slate Star Codex Essays: [Volume I](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55555976-slate-star-codex-essays), [Volume II](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56146392-slate-star-codex-essays), and [Volume III](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56146394-slate-star-codex-essays)
- {% note "William MacAskill - [What We Owe the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59802037-what-we-owe-the-future)" %}Here is [my fawning review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4605878661).{% endnote %}
- John Markoff — [Whole Earth: The Many Lives of Stewart Brand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58503523-whole-earth)
- David Christian — [Big History: The Big Bang, Life On Earth, And The Rise Of Humanity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7956320-big-history)
- {% note "Nick Bilton — [American Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31920777-american-kingpin)" %}So much fun. The soul of a top-tier Netflix true crime drama. The story of Ross Ulbricht's slide from scruffy libertarian ideologue to fearsome remote-work-era crime lord.{% endnote %}
- Tobias Baumann — [Avoiding the Worst: How to Prevent a Moral Catastrophe ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63105075-avoiding-the-worst)
- {% note "John Broome - [Weighing Goods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1557927.Weighing_Goods)"%}I basically never hear people talk about this book, but I think it deserves comparison to Parfit. [Here's](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3187634097?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) a short review.{% endnote %}
- Chris Miller — [Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war)
- David E. Hoffman — [The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and its Dangerous Legacy ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6623920-the-dead-hand)
