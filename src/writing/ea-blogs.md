I thought it might be useful to organise the EA-related blogs I have discovered and enjoyed so far, roughly arranged by topic. I will revisit this and add to it when I have more to add. Some are in fact not remotely EA related but seem to fit in with the vibe and are likely to appeal to EA types, at least to my own lights. I hope someone finds this useful, and discovers at least one blog or writer they didn’t know about. Please email me if you have more suggestions.

## General EA

- Brian Tomasik - [Reducing Suffering](https://reducing-suffering.org/)

  - Executive director of [MIRI](http://mindingourway.com/about/intelligence.org). A recent series on this blog about ‘replacing guilt’ was recently recommended to me, and I found it super useful.

  - Eric is a philosopher, mostly of mind, at U. C. Berkeley. He writes about sci-fi, some very empirically-oriented philosophy, and some experimental philosophy. Particularly well-known for his (skeptical) views about introspection, and some research about whether philosophers of ethics are especially ethical (no, it turns out).
- [The X-Phi Blog](https://xphiblog.com/)
  - Experimental philosophy has a shaky reputation among philosophers, but if you’re into it you’re into it. Schwitzgebel is a contributing writer.
- Maria Popova - [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.or)
  - Lumped in with philosophy blogs but so much more. Not EA-oriented either, but I have to include it because it’s **amazing**.
