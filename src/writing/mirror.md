In a [report in *Science* Policy Forum](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads9158), {% note 'more than 30 leading scientists' %}Including [Jack W. Szostak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_W._Szostak), [John Glass](https://www.jcvi.org/about/john-glass), [Kate Adamala](https://cbs.umn.edu/directory/kate-adamala), [Michael Kay](https://bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/kay/index.php) [George Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Church_(geneticist)), and [Craig Venter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter), many of whom originally had aspirations of helping create mirrored life.{% endnote %} from ten countries are calling on the broader community to confront the risks of mirrored life: “Although we were initially skeptical that mirror bacteria could pose major risks, we have become deeply concerned”.

It accompanies a [300-page technical report](https://doi.org/10.25740/cv716pj4036) which argues such organisms could quickly spread across the world, fatally infect humans, and “directly drive vulnerable plant and animal species to extinction.”

I had the opportunity to co-author an explainer article in the excellent [Asimov Press](https://press.asimov.com/), with [Niko McCarty](https://x.com/NikoMcCarty/). We discuss what it would take to create ‘mirrored life’, the risks from an outbreak of mirrored bacteria, potential countermeasures, and what the world should do about all this.
