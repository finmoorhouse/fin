I've enjoyed others' roundups of the media they've recently enjoyed ([example](http://lukemuehlhauser.com/media-diet-for-q3-2021/)). I've discovered some amazing books, music, and films this way (for the same reason recommendations from friends tend to beat aggregated reviews).

I thought I would look through my own highlights from 2021 in case it helps someone else find something they end up enjoying.

The Robin Hanson homunculus sitting on my shoulder is reminding me that my *real* motivation must surely involve no small amount of signaling, i.e. trying make people think I'm cultured. I accept that is very likely the case!

Ordering is totally arbitrary.

## Books

I keep track of what I read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38695642-fin-moorhouse).

- {% note "Cheryl Misak - [*Frank Ramsey: A Sheer Excess of Powers*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52950063-frank-ramsey)" %}Here is a really lovely <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/787508-i-don-t-feel-the-least-humble-before-the-vastness-of'>quotation</a> attributed to Ramsey (which you may have come across): "I don't feel the least humble before the vastness of the heavens. The stars may be large, but they cannot think or love; and these are qualities which impress me far more than size does. My picture of the world is drawn in perspective, and not like a model to scale. The foreground is occupied by human beings and the stars are all as small as threepenny bits."{% endnote %}
