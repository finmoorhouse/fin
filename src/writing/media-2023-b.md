## Books

I keep track of what I read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38695642-fin-moorhouse) (some written reviews [also live here](https://finmoorhouse.com/writing/book-reviews/)).

- {% note '[Infrastructure: The Book of Everything for the Industrial Landscape](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236866.Infrastructure) — Brian Hayes' %}Not quite finished but sure to be my favourite book of the year. It has a [nice website here](http://industrial-landscape.com).{% image 'http://industrial-landscape.com/art/pole-xformers-hydrant-cell-tower-1000-501.jpg' 'Image from Infrastructure' %}{% endnote %}
- [Bach and the High Baroque](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51976443-bach-and-the-high-baroque) — Robert Greenberg
- [Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109-empire-of-pain) and [Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40163119-say-nothing) — Patrick Radden Keefe
- {% note '[The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/803547.The_Grasshopper) — Bernard Suits' %}Philosopher writes on the nature of games in Aesop/Carroll-style dialogues, plus whimsical illustrations:{% image "https://images.finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2023-b/grasshopper-2.jpg", "Grasshopper" %} {% endnote %}
- [Radical Compassion: Learning to Love Yourself and Your World with the Practice of RAIN](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45358321-radical-compassion) — Tara Brach
- [The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18730716-the-son-also-rises) — Gregory Clark
- {% note '[Elon Musk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122765395-elon-musk) — Walter Isaacson' %}I felt slightly sick reading the Twitter story, like being strapped into a ride I wanted to get off. Partly that might have been just how recent this story was — we are talking less than a _year_ old — and much of it still unfolding. And partly it is some awareness, given what else of the picture we get of Musk, that all this money and energy might have been diverted to something great. Bottled mood of [Uncut Gems](https://letterboxd.com/film/uncut-gems/).{% endnote %}
- [Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33313.Kitchen_Confidential) — Anthony Bourdain

- [Parfit: A Philosopher and His Mission to Save Morality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61388047-parfit) — David Edmonds
- {% note "[Excellent Advice for Living: Wisdom I Wish I'd Known Earlier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62313346-excellent-advice-for-living) — Kevin Kelly" %}"The best way to advise young people is to find out what they really want to do and then advise them to do it" — the best advice is rarely universal but this is [so often true](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/10/high-return-activity-raising-others-aspirations.html){% endnote %}

### Music on YouTube

(Small discursion) A musical sub-genre has emerged on YouTube of 'evocative long-play soundscapes plus relevant visuals'.

Typically you get a descriptive title which sells the mood it plans to evoke; something like:

- *[nintendo relaxing music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrVgdrsp-b8) that calms your mind while it's raining to relax & study to*
- *[The sound of a river](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAzZH6wccew) that melts your brain, the voice of a bird*

You get some nice visuals, maybe subtly animated: a picture of the rainy cafe you're supposed to imagine you're in, an illustration of the video game the music is taking after, or most famously:

{% image 'https://www.images.finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2023-b/lofi-night.webp' 'Lofi girl' %}

Then there's the sound: music, often recycled songs, drawn out and processed. No vocals ever. And comforting sound effects like rain or static.

Think of this as a kind of multimodal heir to the role of much ambient music.

If you spend much time in the right corners of YouTube I expect you'll notice this kind of video as a distinctive phenomenon, otherwise take my word for it. I expect it absorbs far more listening hours than virtually any ambient music labelled as such.

I also notice that so much of these videos are either aimed at evoking nostalgia, or otherwise are full of comments remarking on how nostalgic they feel. For example: '[minecraft music but the nostalgia literally hurts... ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEt4kLTsbQ&t=79s)'. This strikes me as a notable and somewhat new phenomenon: YouTube videos generating vast amounts of nostalgic feelings, especially among young people. What explains that?

## Films and videos

### Films

Didn't watch many, nor venture beyond the already-widely-highly-regarded. Still:

- [Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse](https://letterboxd.com/film/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse/)
- [The Handmaiden](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-handmaiden/)
- And a couple of the new Wes Anderson Roald Dahl adaptations: [Poison](https://letterboxd.com/film/poison-2023/), [The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wonderful-story-of-henry-sugar/), [The Swan](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-swan-2023/). I also have good memories of some of the [source stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6671.The_Wonderful_Story_of_Henry_Sugar_and_Six_More).

Special mention to [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), the website Goodreads could become if it grows up.

- {% note '[Computers are fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbIiAr5dt24)' %}[Wirth's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law) means the fearsome speed of modern computing hides behind layers of software abstraction ("my computer can't be that fast, it's taking five seconds to figure out how to move a window across the screen"). So it pays to sometimes open the top and watch the engine roar.{% endnote %}
