- [2022 (first half)](https://finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2022-a/)
- [2022 (second half)](https://finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2022-b/)

Ordering remains arbitrary. Let me know if you find something from this list that you end up enjoying.

## Books

I keep track of what I read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38695642-fin-moorhouse).

- [One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007533-one-more-thing) — B. J. Novak

- {% note '[A Swim in a Pond in the Rain: In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53487237-a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain) — George Saunders' %}Get the audiobook for Saunder's own gravelly avuncular armchair lecture narration. I also really enjoyed ['The Incredible Buddha Boy'](https://www.gq.com/story/ram-bornjon-miracle-meditating).{% image "writing/media-2023-a/saunders.jpg" "Swim in a Pond" %}{% endnote %}
- [The Hacker and the State: Cyber Attacks and the New Normal of Geopolitics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51589806-the-hacker-and-the-state) — Ben Buchanan
- {% note "[What's Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102146148-what-s-our-problem) — Tim Urban" %}Robin Hanson has [a review](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/tim-urbans-whats-our-problem): "We might try to create and enforce social norms that encourage use of high minds, relative to low. Unfortunately, this distinction just isn’t identified very well in terms of clear enough observables, of the sort that social norms require for successful enforcement [...] I suggest that what would really help are better social institutions"{% endnote %}
- [The Pattern on the Stone: The Simple Ideas that Make Computers Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/277658.The_Pattern_on_the_Stone) — William Daniel Hillis
- {% note '[Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60462182-tracers-in-the-dark) — Andy Greenberg' %}Works incredibly well as a sequel to [American Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road](https://goodreads.com/book/show/31920777.American_Kingpin_The_Epic_Hunt_for_the_Criminal_Mastermind_Behind_the_Silk_Road). The continuity is uncanny.{% endnote %}
- [Labor Econ Versus the World: Essays on the World's Greatest Market](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60211768-labor-econ-versus-the-world) — Bryan Caplan
- [Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279812.Moral_Mazes) — Robert Jackall

- [The Prince of the Marshes: And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81763.The_Prince_of_the_Marshes) — Rory Stewart
- {% note '[The Making of the Atomic Bomb](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16884.The_Making_of_the_Atomic_Bomb)  — Richard Rhodes' %}An arresting passage: "[We were](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17786145-science) lying there, very tense, in the early dawn, and there were just a few  streaks of gold in the east; you could see your neighbor very dimly [...] Suddenly, there was an enormous flash of light, the brightest light I have ever seen or that I think anyone has ever seen [...] It was a vision which was seen with more than the eye [...] A new thing had just been born" To Teller at Compañia Hill  the burst “was like opening the heavy curtains of a darkened room to a  flood of sunlight.” Had astronomers been watching they could have seen  it reflected from the moon, literal moonshine.{% endnote %}

- {% note '[The Ingenious Design of the Aluminum Beverage Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw)' %}In particular, modern soda cans solve the problem of how to create a tab which easily opens the pressurised can, without falling off once opened. Also, the little tab on a drinks can always folds to the left when it's opened. The more you know.{% endnote %}

- {% note '[YouTube, the jewel of the internet](https://www.ft.com/content/c57e3503-6fc0-44dc-9d50-35f8f9da25d2)' %}I think we generally don't appreciate that our willingness to pay for access to sites like YouTube is probably very high. They provide a lot of value which doesn't show up in GDP (in the same way nice weather does). Also, YouTube seems to have solved their comment ranking algorithm? Contrary to what (I imagine) someone who hasn't checked in recently might believe, the top comments on popular videos are almost universally constructive and almost bizarrely nice.{% endnote %}

- {% note '[Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/)' %}Very neat game to get intuitions for prompt injection: find ways to get LLM Gandalf to tell you the password for the level, except LLM Gandalf is instructed not to reveal the word. I'm stuck on level 7.{% endnote %} prompt injection game
- {% note '[Aaronson oracle](https://github.com/elsehow/aaronson-oracle)' %}Scott Aaronson in *Quantum Computing Since Democritus*: "In a class I taught at Berkeley, I did an experiment where I wrote a simple little program that would let people type either “f” or “d” and would predict which key they were going to push next. It’s actually very easy to write a program that will make the right prediction about 70% of the time."{% endnote %}
