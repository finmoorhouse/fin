Cultural signalling, round two!

This is me listing things I enjoyed reading / hearing / watching from the first half of 2022. [Here are my highlights](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/writing/media-2021) for all of 2021.

Ordering remains arbitrary. Let me know if you find something from this list that you end up enjoying.

## Books

I keep track of what I read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38695642-fin-moorhouse).

The books I'd most recommend to my imagined modal reader are [*The most important century*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59244207-the-most-important-century-blog-post-series) and [*Talent*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56269174-talent).

- Joan Didion — [*Slouching Towards Bethlehem*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424.Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem)
- {% note "Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross — [*Talent: How to Identify Energizers, Creatives, and Winners Around the World*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56269174-talent)" %}Interview question ideas: [What](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4745730808?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) is it you do to train that is comparable to a pianist practicing scales? What browser tabs do you currently have open? How hard do you work? What mainstream belief do you think is correct? How ambitious are you? What's a conspiracy theory you're into? What is your most irrational belief?{% endnote %}
- {% note "Adam Hochschild — [*Bury the Chains*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27668.Bury_the_Chains)" %}A good one for exploring the 'Abolition was surprisingly contingent' thesis. Entirely gripping.{% endnote %}
- {% note "Holden Karnofsky — [*The 'most important century' blog post series*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59244207-the-most-important-century-blog-post-series)" %}What does it say that maybe the most compelling case for AI-centric longtermism was written by the co-CEO of a multi-billion dollar philanthropic funder in his spare time? I remember reading this on a flight and despite feeling like I had my head in much of this stuff, I felt like I walked off that plane into a considerably weirder world.{% endnote %}
- Gregory Aldrete — [*History Of The Ancient World: A Global Perspective*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25692796-history-of-the-ancient-world)
- David Reich — [*Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35749414-who-we-are-and-how-we-got-here)
- Brian Blomerth — [*Brian Blomerth's Bicycle Day*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52003981-brian-blomerth-s-bicycle-day)
- Thomas Hager — [*The Alchemy of Air*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3269091-the-alchemy-of-air)
- Bill Gates — [*How to Prevent the Next Pandemic*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59900689-how-to-prevent-the-next-pandemic)
- {% note "Ben Buchanan — [*The New Fire: War, Peace, and Democracy in the Age of AI*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58329461-the-new-fire)" %}Cynical reading: this book considers impacts of AI just before it gets *truly* transformative! Still good however, and fire is an appealing metaphor.{% endnote %}
- {% note "Vaclav Smil — [*Energy and Civilization: A History*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31850765-energy-and-civilization)" %}Did you know that a normal [human metabolic rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_power) is about 80W, and the average person [generates around 100W](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/WeiLiangMok.shtml) over a normal working day? That this is roughly the power required for an [incandescent lightbulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#Efficacy_and_efficiency)? That per capita energy use in the US — the amount of energy each person relies on — is on the order of [10,000 kWh per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption), which is equivalent to around 10 humans working 24/7? And that the world is becoming steadily [less energy intensive](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27032), measured by energy consumption per unit of GDP?{% endnote %}
- Daniel Ellsberg — [*The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663779-the-doomsday-machine)
- {% note "Carl Sagan — [*Cosmos*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55030.Cosmos) (and the [show of the same name](https://letterboxd.com/film/cosmos-a-personal-voyage/))" %}Man, those [opening lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLu1cTKBspI): "[The Cosmos](https://twitter.com/finmoorhouse/status/1517999100347752448) is all that is or was or ever will be...." I found this (unironically, sincerely) moving and I wish there were more efforts at such ambitious writing and filmmaking today. Grand in scope, scientifically literate, authentic, poetic.{% endnote %}
- Adam Fisher — *[Valley of Genius: The Uncensored History of Silicon Valley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36382335-valley-of-genius)*

## Music

I log most things on [rateyourmusic.com](https://rateyourmusic.com/~finm). I also have a [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/finmoorhouse) with some playlists.

In particular listen to ['Long Season'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEGR_PHKK9g); the last song of the [last show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishmans#1998%E2%80%932004:_Otokotachi_no_Wakare,_death_of_Sato,_and_disbandment) they performed together. I like how after the song ends, the room just hangs in a kind of stunned silence for a good 10 seconds before applause.{% endnote %}

## Other things

Podcasts, films, TV, videos, shorter writing.

If you're interested in using your career to work on very important problems, you should listen to the [80,000 Hours Podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/) if you don't already.
