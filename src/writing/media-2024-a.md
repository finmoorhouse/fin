## Books

I keep track of what I read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38695642-fin-moorhouse) (written reviews [also live here](https://finmoorhouse.com/writing/book-reviews/)).

- {% note '[Infrastructure: The Book of Everything for the Industrial Landscape ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236866.Infrastructure) — Brian Hayes' %}Steamships, steam trains, trams, mills, mines, and smokestacks are charming to us now. But the lego bricks of the modern industrial world are ugly (and to that extent more unpopular) by consensus. I wonder how much generalised “aversion to industry” is a kind of aesthetic aversion. If so, the sights of industry feel less ugly to me now; now I know some things about how they work and why they look that way. I am very happy this book exists.
  {% endnote %}
- {% note '[Modern Principles of Economics ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6659172-modern-principles-of-economics)' %}I realised recently that all the books about econ I'd read were more like *commentaries on the field of economics*. Actually working through micro 101 was very rewarding and I should have read this book much earlier. The [MRU videos](https://www.youtube.com/@MarginalRevolutionUniversity) are also corny and great.{% endnote %}
- [Nuclear War: A Scenario ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182733784-nuclear-war) — Annie Jacobsen
- [Proof and the Art of Mathematics ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51456721-proof-and-the-art-of-mathematics) — Joel David Hamkins
- {% note '[Pieces of the Action ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290284-pieces-of-the-action) — Vannevar Bush' %}{% img 'writing/media-2024-a/apota.jpg' 'Alt text' %}{% endnote %}
- [The Timeless Way of Building](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106728.The_Timeless_Way_of_Building) — Christopher Alexander
- [Not the End of the World: How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145624737-not-the-end-of-the-world) — Hannah Ritchie
- [Understanding Japan: A Cultural History ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26038087-understanding-japan) and [The Rise of Modern Japan ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59604052-the-rise-of-modern-japan) — Mark Ravina
- [NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22514020-neurotribes) — Steve Silberman
- [Great Masters: Beethoven - His Life and Music ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2523656.Great_Masters) — Robert Greenberg
- {% note '[Elements of Jazz: From Cakewalks to Fusion ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4802475-elements-of-jazz) — Bill Messenger' %}Some nice etymology here. “Jazz” itself is a serious puzzle; “one of the most sought-after word origins in modern American English”. “Gism”, later “jasm” was a piece of mid-19th c. slang for “verve, energy”. When the French brought perfumery to New Orleans, they brought oil of jasmine, where to where a perfume would be to “jass it up”. Or did it come from baseball journalism, where it meant “enthusiasm, “fighting spirit”?{% endnote %}
- [Great Mambo Chicken And The Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over The Edge ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665412.Great_Mambo_Chicken_And_The_Transhuman_Condition) — Ed Regis

- [Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208707460-deep-utopia) — Nick Bostrom
- [Anarchy, State, and Utopia ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/479572.Anarchy_State_and_Utopia) — Robert Nozick
- [The Fabric of Reality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/177068.The_Fabric_of_Reality) — David Deutsch

## Films and videos

- {% note '[The Curse](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-curse-2023/) (2023)' %}As far as I can tell this is something entirely new in popular TV — a kind of unrelenting cringe horror for which I have no reference points and which has zero obvious mainstream appeal.
