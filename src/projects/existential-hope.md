I joined the [‘Existential Hope’ podcast](https://www.existentialhope.com/podcasts), a project of the [Foresight Institute](https://foresight.org/).

They wrote the following precis:

>For years, the conversation about the long-term future has been  dominated by a crucial question: how do we avoid extinction? But what if ensuring our survival is only half the battle? In this episode,  Beatrice is joined by Fin Moorhouse, a researcher at Forethought and  co-author with Will MacAskill of the *Better Futures* series, to make the case for focusing on the other half: flourishing. Or as we'd like to say in this podcast: Existential Hope!

>
>Fin challenges the idea that a great future will emerge automatically if we just avoid the worst-case scenarios. Using the analogy of a grand  sailing expedition, he explores the complexities of navigating towards a truly optimal world, questioning whether our current moral compass is  enough to guide us.
>

>The conversation dives into the concept of  "moral catastrophes"—profound ethical failings, like industrial animal  farming, that could persist even in technologically advanced futures.  Fin also tackles the complex challenges posed by digital minds, from the risk of accidental suffering to the creation of "willing servants." He  argues for the power of "moral trade" as a tool to build a more  pluralistic and prosperous world, and explains why we should aim for a  "Viatopia"—a stable and self-sustaining state that makes a great future  highly likely.
