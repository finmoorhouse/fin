In late 2023 I spoke with [Dr Alex Davidson](https://alex-davidson.ghost.io/) for his [Computational Medicine Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-computational-medicine-podcast/id1636518755).

We talked about indoor air quality, whether you should become a doctor if you want to save lives, the state of effective altruism, and lessons from podcasting.

You can also watch [the video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4nqQpig5E).
