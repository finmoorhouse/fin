As part of my work, I significantly contributed to two linked projects on what could be achieved from a year of the wealthiest 1% in the world giving ≈10% of their income.

### TED talk

The first of these projects was a main stage TED talk delivered by my colleague Natalie Cargill in Vancouver. I worked with Natalie to help conceive of and write the talk.

If over one year the world's richest gave 10% of their income, or 2.5% of their wealth (whichever is highest), this would raise around **$3.5 trillion**. What could we achieve with that much money, if we wanted to improve the world? Could we actually just *fix* some of the world's biggest problems? That's the premise of the talk.

### Research report

The second project was a research report based on the premise of the TED talk, where I was ostensibly the lead author. It was a collaboration between Longview colleagues Natalie Cargill, Tyler John, and Kit Harris; plus [Riley Harris](https://www.millionyearview.com/), who did a huge amount of the preliminary fact-finding. The report became fairly ambitious, clocking in at over 50 pages.

Below are some nice slides from the report and graphics I made from the report.
