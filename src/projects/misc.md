Longtermism is the view that positively influencing the long-term future is a key moral priority of our time. I think it's an idea more people should know about.

But if you're new to longtermism, it can be difficult to know where to start learning about it. So I made [longtermism.com](https://longtermism.com/) to help a general audience quickly get up to speed with what longtermism means, and why it could matter.

The site includes an [introduction](https://longtermism.com/introduction) essay, an [FAQ](https://longtermism.com/faq), a list of [resources](https://longtermism.com/resources) to learn more, and a list of [ways to get involved](https://longtermism.com/get-involved).

I'd really value constructive feedback about this project — if you spot a mistake, disagree with a point, think I missed something obvious, or have any ideas for making the site better, [I'd love to hear from you](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/contact/).
