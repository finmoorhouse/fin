I recently joined [Elle Griffin](https://www.elysian.press), [Tomas Pueyo](https://twitter.com/tomaspueyo), and [Maarten Boudry](https://maartenboudry.substack.com/) for a discussion around '[How to imagine better futures](https://www.elysian.press/p/symposium-is-it-possible-to-imagine)'.

We talked about:

- How important is it to create more positive visions of the future?
- Why is it so hard?
- Should we still try to imagine what 10,000 years from now could look like?
- Is/was classic sci-fi as influential as it seems anecdotally? 
- How much bigger is the gap from now to utopia compared to the gap from prehistory to now?
- What kind of future are we hoping for?

I really enjoyed this one, and recommend you check out Elle, Tomas, and Maarten's respective writing.

If you have a reason for watching it without paying to hop the paywall, email me.

The conversation was moderated by [Luke Ferris](https://open.substack.com/users/43021614-luke-ferris).
