I joined the [“What is the Future for Cities”](https://wtf4cities.com/) podcast, hosted by architect [Fanni Melles](http://fannimelles.com).

This was a very dilettantish interview but I enjoyed it a lot. We talked about [Alain Bertaud](https://alainbertaud.com/), beauty in architecture as an externality, and cities after AGI.
