Before I started working full-time, I made a lot of films. Some of this was freelance filmmaking as a way to make money; other films I made to enter into small contests, and similar.

Here are some highlights:

### The Packhorse documentary (unfinished)

[The Packhorse Pub](https://packhorsebath.co.uk/) in Bath is a 600 year-old building in the village of South Stoke. In 2015, it was shut down, and the derelict building was bought by a property developer with a plan to convert it to an office or residential building. While applications to change it were blocked by the village, the building fell into disrepair.

Then a group of volunteers in the village began an effort to save the pub by buying it back as a collective. So began a lengthy effort to raise the funds needed to buy and restore the Packhorse to the communal heart of the village.

This was the story I wanted to tell in a short documentary. I started filming in around 2017, and collected dozens of hours of footage. My favourite interview was with a man who was [born in the pub in 1930](https://packhorsebath.co.uk/our-story/the-packhorse-remembered/), and married his wife Edith after he got notice about being posted to Egypt in the air force:

> In 1951, I began my National Service and was given short notice of my posting to Egypt. Edith and I decided to marry that weekend. I was  allowed 48 hours’ leave for the purpose. As soon as he had finished his  delivery round, Farmer Wilson drove Edith in the milk van to obtain a  special licence from the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Our wedding, after a  frantic two days of preparations, took place in St James’ on 3 November  1951, with a reception in Bob and Doris’ front room in the Packhorse.  Doris stayed up late the night before, transforming a birthday cake into a wedding cake. Everyone contributed food, at a time when rationing was still in effect. This month we celebrated our 65th anniversary and, as we do every year, we returned to the church and the village to reminisce.

I was part of the way through editing the film before I got tied up in my studies, and later in full-time work. The film would have been around half an hour long. If anyone would like to finish editing a film about a pub in a village in Somerset — drop me a line.

### Growth

https://vimeo.com/81992670

*Growth* is a short animation about a farmer who grows a corn  maze. The landscapes of the films were made through a mix of  photography, paper cut-outs, and 3D models. For instance, the farmer  himself and his house were cut out of card and digitally scanned,and the fields of grass and wheat were modelled and animated in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). I was 14 years old when I made it and I would hve done some things differently today. Still, I'm still quite proud of it.

### Pamoja

In 2015 I was given the opportunity to produce three films for a live orchestral accompaniment, to be projected during a concert in the Bath Assembly Rooms. Composer Mark David Boden scored the music and handed the result to me to work from.

The first film uses footage from a trip to Kenya. The second is a short wordless film following my little sister as she wakes up early to take a photo of the sunrise. It [won a 'Future8' award](https://web.archive.org/web/20220203025327/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/future-8-tech-teenagers-awards). The third is an animation about a man who opens his office door to a series of new worlds.

### Crossfit competitions

I made videos for [Strength in Depth](https://strengthindepth.com), a series of 'fitness racing' competitions across the UK.

I covered the events, interviewed atheletes, made animated promotional films, and similar. Crossfit competitions are surprisingly fun to be part of.

You can watch some of the videos on the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9LKEdWKq4R2WG_-oVbjbQ/videos) channel, although not all of them are mine. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTZjUBEhdDg) an example of a promotional clip.

### Showreels

These are from 2016 (when I was 17), a year or so before I stopped making films.
