‘Preparing for the Intelligence Explosion’ is a paper I co-authored with Will MacAskill, for [Forethought](https://www.forethought.org/).

You can read the report [on the Forethought website here](https://www.forethought.org/research/preparing-for-the-intelligence-explosion), and you can [download a PDF version here](https://www.forethought.org/research/preparing-for-the-intelligence-explosion.pdf).

Here is the abstract:

> AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions, in rapid succession. We call these developments *grand challenges*.
>
> These challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies, races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral consideration. We could also miss opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life and collective decision-making.
>
> We argue that these challenges cannot always be delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing, now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would bring.
